**Executive Summary**
The EPFL student gym is a heavily subsidized campus service whose mission is to provide inclusive, safe, and comfortable access to
physical activity. Persistent overcrowding, long waiting times, and uneven access across student groups indicate that current usage levels
exceed what the facility can sustain without degrading user experience and equity.
Using a data-driven model based on EPFL gym usage and designed to promote equal access while prioritising under-represented student
groups, we found that:
  • The optimal average occupancy of the gym is approximately 58 students at any given time.
  • The maximum number of students who can safely be in the gym at the same time is 123 students.
  • The optimal configuration includes 16 hours of daily opening, with a stable equipment inventory of about 58 machines.
  • Operating above this level sharply increases waiting times, crowding discomfort, and equipment overuse, while disproportionately
affecting under-represented groups (women and students with disabilities).

The recommended configuration reduces annual maintenance costs by approximately 60% while improving overall access quality.
We recommend that EPFL immediately adopt a hard occupancy cap of 123 students combined with extended opening hours, and gradually
introduce measures that encourage students to visit at less busy times and improve access for under-represented groups over the following
academic year. Together, these measures will translate analytical results into a practical, fair, and robust access policy.
